***************************************************


/*
There are a number of variables we intend to integrate into the logistic regression analysis.

Firstly, the relevant dependent variable is "discriminated" for the analysis over all years and "discriminated2002",
"discriminated2004", etc. for the regression analysis over one specific year. These are dummy variables we
have previously created using the variable dscrgrp ("Member of a group discriminated against in this country"; 1=yes, 0=no).

Secondly, the relevant independent variable is "gdp_t" for the analysis over all years and "gdp2002_t",
"gdp2004_t", etc. for the regression analysis over one specific year.

Thirdly, we included several control variables. We tried to include variables that might induce
discrimination based on perceived economic threats and perceived cultural threats. From a wide
range of potential variables we selected
- for the analysis over all years:
	"education"
	"traditions"
	"stayduration"
	
	Here, we couldn't include the variable of net household income as it was measured in different ways
	before and after the fourth survey wave (see do-file "data preparation").
	
- for the analysis over one specific year (2002, 2004, etc.):
	"education"
	"traditions"
	"income_t"
	"stayduration"

The problem was that there were probably no observations for immigrants that had both a value for the self-perceived
level of discrimination (discminated2018) and for the GDP per capita of their country of origin (gdp2018_t).
This could be the case because maybe none of the immigrants answered the question wheater thyy feel discriminated or not.

their attitudes towards immigrant's based on their countries of origin's GDP's, and based
on other aspects, such as their level of education. Into this descriptive analysis, we tried

* comparing the means of the two variables using a paired-samples t-test:
ttest impcntr == imrcntr

/* 
This t-test was conducted on 39'821 survey participants to determine if they have in average different attitudes about allowing immigrants from poorer versus richer countries than the one they live in.
 
Results showed that the mean attitude regarding immigrants of poorer countries was statistically significantly different from the mean attitude regarding immigrants of richer countries (t = 15.3859 with df=39820, p < 0.0001) at a significance level of 0.05.
 
A 95% confidence interval for the true difference in population means resulted in the interval of (0.0449442, 0.0580668).

One limitation of using the t-test here is that arguably the variables are not on an interval scale but rather an ordinal one. If we suppose that, the results of this test are not useful because the paired-samples t-test needs variables on an interval scale.
